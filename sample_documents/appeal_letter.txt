    Claim Number: CLM-2024-556677
    Date of Service: Requested for 11/15/2024

Dear Appeals Committee,

I am writing to formally appeal the denial of prior authorization for an MRI of the lumbar spine for my patient, Emily Thompson (DOB: 05/12/1978, Member ID: BCBS-2024-445566).

DENIAL INFORMATION
Denial Date: October 20, 2024
Denial Reason: "Not medically necessary at this time. Conservative treatment not adequately documented."
Denial Code: D-1234

PATIENT HISTORY
Ms. Thompson is a 46-year-old female who has been experiencing severe lower back pain radiating down her left leg for the past 8 months. Her symptoms have significantly impacted her quality of life and ability to work.

CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT COMPLETED
Contrary to the denial reason, Ms. Thompson has undergone extensive conservative treatment:

1. Physical Therapy (12 weeks)
   - Provider: Chicago Physical Therapy Center
   - Dates: March 1, 2024 - May 24, 2024
   - Sessions: 24 sessions, twice weekly
   - Result: Minimal improvement, pain persists

2. Medication Management (8 months)
   - NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 800mg TID (March-June 2024)
   - Muscle Relaxants: Cyclobenzaprine 10mg QHS (April-July 2024)
   - Neuropathic Pain: Gabapentin 300mg TID (May-Present)
   - Result: Partial pain relief, but symptoms persist

3. Epidural Steroid Injections (2 rounds)
   - First injection: July 15, 2024
   - Second injection: September 10, 2024
   - Result: Temporary relief (2-3 weeks), then return of symptoms

4. Activity Modification and Home Exercise Program
   - Ongoing since March 2024
   - Limited effectiveness

CURRENT CLINICAL PRESENTATION
- Pain Level: 8/10 on visual analog scale
- Location: Lower back with radiation to left leg (L5-S1 distribution)
- Character: Sharp, shooting pain with numbness and tingling
- Aggravating Factors: Sitting, bending, lifting
- Relieving Factors: Lying down (partial relief only)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS
- Positive straight leg raise test on left at 30 degrees
- Decreased sensation in L5 dermatome
- Weakness in left ankle dorsiflexion (4/5 strength)
- Diminished left Achilles reflex
- Tenderness over L5-S1 region

RED FLAGS PRESENT
- Progressive neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness)
- Failure of conservative treatment over 8 months
- Impact on activities of daily living
- Inability to work (patient on medical leave)

MEDICAL NECESSITY JUSTIFICATION
An MRI of the lumbar spine is medically necessary for the following reasons:

1. Diagnostic Clarity: To identify the specific cause of radiculopathy (disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or other pathology)

2. Treatment Planning: Results will guide further treatment decisions, potentially including:
   - Targeted interventional procedures
   - Surgical consultation if indicated
   - Modification of current treatment plan

3. Progressive Symptoms: Patient's neurological symptoms are worsening despite aggressive conservative management

4. Standard of Care: Current clinical guidelines support advanced imaging after failure of 6-8 weeks of conservative treatment

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Enclosed please find:
- Physical therapy records (24 sessions)
- Medication history and prescriptions
- Procedure notes from epidural injections
- Office visit notes documenting progression
- Functional assessment showing work disability

CLINICAL GUIDELINES SUPPORT
According to the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria and North American Spine Society guidelines, MRI is appropriate for:
- Radiculopathy lasting >6 weeks
- Failure of conservative treatment
- Progressive neurological deficits
- Consideration for interventional or surgical treatment

All of these criteria are met in Ms. Thompson's case.

PATIENT IMPACT
Without this diagnostic study:
- Continued suffering and decreased quality of life
- Inability to return to work (financial hardship)
- Risk of permanent neurological damage
- Delayed appropriate treatment
- Potential for condition to worsen

REQUESTED ACTION
I respectfully request that you:
1. Overturn the denial of prior authorization
2. Approve MRI of lumbar spine without contrast (CPT 72148)
3. Expedite the review given the patient's progressive symptoms

URGENCY
This is an urgent matter. Ms. Thompson's symptoms are progressively worsening, and timely diagnosis is critical to prevent permanent neurological damage and guide appropriate treatment.

I am available to discuss this case further and provide any additional information needed. Please contact me at (555) 123-4567 or via fax at (555) 123-4568.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this appeal. I look forward to a favorable resolution that will allow my patient to receive the necessary diagnostic care.
